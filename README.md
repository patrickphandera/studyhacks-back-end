# StudyHacks Back-End

Welcome to the StudyHacks Back-End project! This README will guide you through setting up the server and installing the required dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.11 (You can use Anaconda or a virtual environment)
- MongoDB (Make sure it's installed and running)
- Git

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/studyhacks-back-end.git
cd studyhacks-back-end

## Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
- It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies.

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install Required Packages
Use pip to install the necessary Python packages from the requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
Create a .env file in the project's root directory to store your environment variables and configuration settings. You can use the .env.example file as a template.

Update the values in .env to match your specific configuration, such as database connection details and API keys.

Running the Application
You can start the application by running the following command:

python app.py


The application should start and be accessible at http://localhost:5000 by default. You can access the API endpoints from there.

API Documentation
You can find the API documentation by visiting http://localhost:5000/documentation after starting the server. This page provides information on the available API endpoints and how to use them.
